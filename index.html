        <p class='para1'> Welcome to animal website. Here you will get everything you want to know about animals.
            Animals are divided into three groups regarding which way they give birth to their young
            ones,their body texture and style,etc.. These three groups are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mammals</li>
            <li>Reptiles</li>
            <li>Amphibians</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='mammals'> Mammals </h2>
        <p class='para2'>A mammal is a vertebrate animal of the class Mammalia. Mammals are 
            characterized by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a 
            neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. These 
            characteristics distinguish them from reptiles and birds, from which their ancestors 
            diverged in the Carboniferous Period over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant 
            species of mammals have been described and divided into 29 orders.
            The largest orders of mammals, by number of species, are the rodents, bats, and 
            Eulipotyphla (including hedgehogs, moles and shrews). The next three are the Primates 
            (including humans,monkeys and lemurs), the even-toed ungulates (including pigs, camels, 
            and whales), and the Carnivora (including cats, dogs, and seals). Most mammals are 
            intelligent, with some possessing large brains, self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can 
            communicate and vocalize in several ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-
            marking, alarm signals, singing, echolocation; and, in the case of humans, complex 
            language.  </p>

        <h2 class='reptiles'> Reptiles </h2>
        <p class='para3'> Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia 
            a paraphyletic grouping comprising all sauropsids except birds. Living reptiles comprise 
            turtles, crocodilians, squamates (lizards and snakes) and rhynchocephalians (tuatara). As 
            of March 2022, the Reptile Database includes about 11,700 species. Reptilia has been 
            subject to numerous conflicting taxonomic definitions.[3][4] In the traditional Linnaean 
            classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, 
            crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and 
            so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the 
            term as a clade. Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor 
            of the clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern 
            reptiles than to mammals. The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in 
            combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. Reptiles are 
            tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are descended
            from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval 
            stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous,
            as were some extinct aquatic clades[6]  – the fetus develops within the mother, using a 
            (non-mammalian) placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs 
            are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to 
            reproduction on dry land.  </p>

        <h2 class='amphibians'> Amphibians </h2>
        <p class='para4'> Amphibians are four-limbed and ectothermic vertebrates of the class 
            Amphibia. All living amphibians belong to the group Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide 
            variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or 
            freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in
            water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.
            The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing
             form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some 
             small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They
              are superficially similar to reptiles like lizards but, along with mammals and birds, 
              reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their 
              complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological 
              indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations 
              many species around the globe. </p>
